              <p>
                The Metabolic Repair Program has been designed to provide you
                with an alternative way of eating getting you in shape and
                healthy state. Traditional dieting protocols follow the very
                basic template of: reduce calories > lose weight > balance the
                metabolism. In this program, we will look at reversing this
                process, to create a new dieting formula to achieve great
                results. <br />
                <br />
                Who is it for? This program is perfect if you have fallen into
                consistent ‘eat less, exercise more’ routine and are feeling
                tired, beat, hungry, bloated, anxious and depressed as a result.
                You are likely not seeing the results you expect despite under
                eating and exercising hard. It’s also perfect if you have spent
                years under eating and following drastic fad diets. When the
                traditional methods of losing weight are no longer working for
                you, this is the program for you.
                <br />
                <br />
                How long does it last? It is recommended that you follow this
                program for 4-8 weeks at a time.

              <p>
                ntolerances/allergies/sensitivities to certain food groups can
                suppress hormones and disrupt the digestive system. This usually
                results in poor outcomes and despite your best efforts, progress
                can come to a complete halt. This program encourages a
                controlled eating plan that removes typical food intolerances
                along with those that may be individual to you. <br /><br />
                Who is it for? This program is perfect for you who would like to
                improve digestive system health.
                <br /><br />
                How long does it last? It is recommended that you follow this
                program for 6 weeks. After that, a more balanced and less
                restrictive long term approach should be taken.

              <p>
                In the program you will truly understand how important your
                habits are to achieving a healthy body while showing you the
                essential nutrition and lifestyle habits you need to put in
                place and follow through with every day.
                <br /><br />
                In this program there is no mention of calories or nutrition
                plans – it’s all about making small yet high impact habit
                changes.
                <br /><br />
                Who is it for? This program is perfect for beginner (level 1)
                and developing clients (level 2). Many clients are just getting
                started on improving their nutrition and lifestyle, so don’t
                need customization information just yet, so here we will outline
                the basics first and leave the individualisation for later. Even
                those who consider themselves advanced would do well to review
                the basics first, even if just as a refresher.
                <br /><br />
                How long does it last? I recommended that each habit challenge
                is conducted for at least 2 weeks.
