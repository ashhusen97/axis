            Hi, I’m Sonya and I am a registered nutritional therapist and health
            coach. <br /><br />
            If you’re experiencing digestive issues, IBS and in the
            perimenopausal stage of your life with unwanted hormonal symptoms,
            I’m here to help you. <br />
            <br />
            I love helping women with health concerns because I’m passionate
            about it myself. I have struggled with IBS, bloating and pain for
            years, experimenting with new diets and educating myself on the best
            food choices to make. I went searching for alternatives after
            conventional medicine gave short-term relief to my symptoms and a
            visit to a Naturopath Practitioner, I started seeing changes within
            a week after implementing the nutritional plan to manage my
            digestives issues. <br /><br />
            To better understand my symptoms, and to empower myself to help
            others, I retrained and switch from a successful career in business
            consultancy to focus on health and wellness. I wanted to delve
            deeper into the scientific aspect on the importance of nutrition and
            a change in lifestyle and how these support the body to overcome
            symptoms. <br /><br />
            I understand the connection and the importance of holistic health
            where one size does not fit all. I am confident in separating food
            facts from fiction and how behavioural science contributes to food
            choices. <br /><br />
            What breaks my heart when it comes to doing this work is seeing
            women accepting that their symptoms of pain and discomfort are just
            a part of life! Trying out every diet, supplement and vitamins but
            eventually, leaving you fed up and frustrated, which hampers you
            from reaching your life potential as you are disabled with unwanted
            symptoms. It breaks my heart because there is an answer; you don’t
            have to live with your symptoms, it doesn’t have to be this way. I
            can help and together we can find your ‘root‘ to wellness, vitality
            and energy. <br /><br />
            If you are looking for support in overcoming digestive issues,
            bloating, pain, perimenopausal hormonal issues, migraines, sleep,
            and restoring your health, you are in the right place. <br /><br />
            I look forward to starting this journey with you. Sonya
