                You have discovered that making changes to your health is vital
                to living your best life, a life you deserve. You have gone
                through being a youth in your 20’s and now still want to feel
                full of energy and vitality to cope with the day to day
                challenges at work, with the family and your children.
                <br />
                But there is a problem. An inner voice tends to cast doubt as
                there are too many plates you need to keep spinning, coupled
                with the reality that you are advancing in years.
                <br />
                The result – you simply view mediocre health at this time of
                your life as the accepted norm.
              </p>
              <p class="">
                Let me guess, you have read books and magazine have seen lots of
                articles about boosting energy or optimising your sleep, and the
                ones you have tried, had a temporary effect if any at all. You
                have spoken to friends, your mother, have exchanged tips and
                tricks and even been to a workshop but still experiencing your
                symptoms. You have joined many online groups, have seen other
                women thriving but you are merely surviving, have given up
                accepting that these symptoms are your life. I understand it’s
                hard to make changes to your diet, our emotions and beliefs are
                tied up with eating and food. I feel your frustration.

                Hi, I’m Sonya and I am a registered nutritional therapist and
                health coach.
                <br />
                If you’re experiencing digestive issues, IBS and in the
                perimenopausal stage of your life with unwanted hormonal
                symptoms, I’m here to help you.
                <br />
                I love helping women with health concerns because I’m passionate
                about it myself. I have struggled with IBS, bloating and pain
                for years, experimenting with new diets and educating myself on
                the best food choices to make. I went searching for alternatives
                after conventional medicine gave short-term relief to my
                symptoms and a visit to a Naturopath Practitioner, I started
                seeing changes within a week after implementing the nutritional
                plan to manage my digestives issues.
                <br />
                To better understand my symptoms, and to empower myself to help
                others, I retrained and switch from a successful career in
                business consultancy to focus on health and wellness. I wanted
                to delve deeper into the scientific aspect on the importance of
                nutrition and a change in lifestyle and how these support the
                body to overcome symptoms. I understand the connection and the
                importance of holistic health where one size does not fit all. I
                am confident in separating food facts from fiction and how
                behavioural science contributes to food choices.
                <br />
                What breaks my heart when it comes to doing this work is seeing
                women accepting that their symptoms of pain and discomfort are
                just a part of life! Trying out every diet, supplement and
                vitamins but eventually, leaving you fed up and frustrated,
                which hampers you from reaching your life potential as you are
                disabled with unwanted symptoms.
                <br />
                It breaks my heart because there is an answer; you don’t have to
                live with your symptoms, it doesn’t have to be this way. I can
                help and together we can find your ‘root‘ to wellness, vitality
                and energy.
                <br />
                If you are looking for support in overcoming digestive issues,
                bloating, pain, perimenopausal hormonal issues, migraines,
                sleep, and restoring your health, you are in the right place.
                <br />
                I look forward to starting this journey with you.
                <br />
                Sonya
